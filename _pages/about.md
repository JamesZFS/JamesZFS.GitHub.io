I am a PhD candidate starting in 2024 at the [Computer Graphics and Visualization group](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/intelligent-systems/computer-graphics-and-visualization), TU Delft.

My research focuses on real-time rendering for AR/VR applications, with strong interests in physics-based rendering as well. Its elegance, predictability, controllability, interactivity, and interdisciplinary nature, make rendering the most charming subject to me. I worked on a [master thesis](/publication/2024-07-01-spatial) about path guiding, supervised by [Disney Research Zurich](https://studios.disneyresearch.com/) and [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/overview.html). Prior to this, I explored various rendering-related topics including compilers, denoising, and data-driven methods. I am also enthusiastic about unraveling the intricacies of the appearance of materials.

I obtained my master's degree at ETH Zurich and my bachelor's degree at Tsinghua University. I was an graphics programming intern at Bytedance Game Department in the summer, 2020, and a research intern at the [Realistic Graphics Lab](https://rgl.epfl.ch/), EPFL in the summer, 2022.

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, painting, and music making.
