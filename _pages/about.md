Welcome to my homepage! 

My name is Fengshi Zheng (郑逢时). I'm a computer science master student at ETH Zurich, majoring in computer graphics. My research interest lies in **physics-based rendering**. Its elegance, predictability, controllability, interactivity, and interdisciplinary nature, make it the most charming subject to me. I am currently working on a master thesis about path guiding, supervised by [Disney Research Zurich](https://studios.disneyresearch.com/) and [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/overview.html). Prior to this, I explored various rendering-related topics including compilers, denoising, and data-driven methods. I am also enthusiastic about unraveling the intricacies of the appearance of materials.

I graduated from Tsinghua University with double backgrounds in physics and computer science. I was a research fellow at the [Graphics & Geometric Computing Group](https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/). I was an graphics programming intern at Bytedance Game Department in the summer, 2020, and a research intern at [Realistic Graphics Lab](https://rgl.epfl.ch/), EPFL in the summer, 2022.

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, swimming, and music making.
