Taiwan is one of my favortite places in the world. I was always fascinated by its mixed culture, well-kept tradition, unique landscape, and diverse food. The moderate living pace and friendliness of people add up to its beauty.

I toured Taipei, Keelung, etc. in my leisure time during a summer program offered by National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu.
